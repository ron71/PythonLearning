# Exercise 16.1
# Write a program that reads the contents of the file “pc_woodchuck.txt,”
# splits it into words (where everything that is not a letter is considered a word boundary),
# and case-insensitively builds a dictionary that stores for every word how often it occurs in
# the text. Then print all the words with their quantities in alphabetical order.

print(bytes([255]))
x = b'hello\x20world'

print(x.decode())
